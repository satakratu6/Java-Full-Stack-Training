code -> compiler -> byte code -> JVM (JIT+Interpreter) -> Binary code
JRE -> Inbuilt Libraries + JVM
JDK -> Development tools + JRE
Java is a high level programming language which is easily readable, understandable and instructable by programmer. Java is a platform independent language because in Java Source code is converted into byte code which is easily executable in any platform which has JVM.
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It is physically doesn't exist. It is used to convert byte code into binary code. It consists of JIT and Interpreter. 
JRE-> Java Runtime Environment -> Physically exists. Its used to provide the environment to run the java programme. 
JDK-> It stands for JDK. It is physically exists. It provides an environment to run as well as to develop the java program. 
System.out.print-> After printing the data the cursor is shifted to next position in same line 
System.out.println -> After printing the data the cursor is shifted to next position in new line
Tokens -> The smallest part of java progam is known as tokens.
Four types of Tokens:
1) keywords -> 50+, compiler aware words, always in lower case (its predifined) . eg: class, public, static, void etc.
2) identifiers -> class name, variable name, package name, package name. The name given by progammer is known as identifier. 
Some rules : 
a) We can't use keywords as identifiers
b) We can't use space 
c) Can't start with numbers
d) We can't use special characters except _ and $ 
3) Literals: The value or data given by programmer is known as literals.
Types of Literals
a)Numbers:  10-> Integer number
            10.o -> Floating Numbers
b)characters:   It is used to represent a single data. It is enclosed in inside single qoute. Length of characters is always one. We can use uppercase characters, lowercase characters, digits, and all type of special characters
c) String:  It is used to represent group of characters. It is enclosed in inside double qoutes. The Length of string literal can be anything. 
d) Boolean: Boolean gives us only two values, either true or false
4) Seperators: Is used to seperate java memebers
{} -> blocks
() -> equations, method declarations, conditions
; -> end of the statements
, -> variables
. -> reference

Data Types: It is used to define what type of data we are storing in any variable
a)Primitive Datatype:
Inbuilt datatype, fixed size
Integer number: 
            types   size    in bits
            byte    1 byte  8 bits
            short   2 byte  16 bits
            int     4 byte  32 bits
            long    8 byte  64 bits
Floating numbers:
            Float   4 bytes 32 bits
            double  8 byte  64 bits
characters:
            char    2 byte  16 bits
bool:
            bool    1 bit
b)Non-primitive datatype:
->Does not have fixed size
-> User defined size, eg: String
Variables:
Types of variables:
1) Based on datatypes: primitive variables and non-primitive variables
2) Based on Scope : 
    a) Global Variable -> Declared inside a class, it has two types: static variable and non-static variable
    b) Local Variable -> Declared in a local area or a method 
Static variable: A variable which is declared inside the class area or global area prefixed with static keyword is known as static keyword
Non- Static variable: A variable which is declared inside the class area or global area prefixed without static keyword is known as non static keyword
Points
1)We can't use local variables without initilization
2)Local Varibables are not assigned with default value
3) We can't create two local variables with same name
4)Local variablea can be used only inside same local area
5) We can use global variables inside global areas as well as local areas
Q1) Area of Sqaure whose side is 4.2
Q2)Area of circle whose radius is 5
Q3) Area of rectangle whose length is 3.5 and breadth is 4
